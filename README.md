# Medicine-That-Listens-Medicine-That-Acts
Open dialogue without judgements for progress and challenging critical thinking in an ad-free space. To discuss a new system to life, beyond currencies to value Life again. Medicine That Listens, Medicine That Acts.

Here is a starting foundation that is expanding of the efforts and means I am willing to stand on but talk about openly, without being rigid.
I am trying, in my own ways, to provide innovations to the medical field, removing the sanctity of a life from any external means.
It is never going to be easy. The things in life worthwhile, rarely ever are.
